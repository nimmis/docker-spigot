# Script to add a google maps key to overviewer if there isn't one already 
#
# Working around issue:
# https://github.com/overviewer/Minecraft-Overviewer/issues/1308
#
# This script is run at startup and also once a day, just in case
# overviewer is updated and the source index.html needs re-patching.
#
# Overviewer copies the source index.html at the beginning of the render,
# and then takes its sweet time rendering tiles, meaning for at least 3
# minutes (possibly lots more if someone has explored the map) the website
# is unusable. Patching the source index ensures it is copied and the map
# always works.
